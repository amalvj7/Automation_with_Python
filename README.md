# Excel Data Processing and Visualization

This Python project demonstrates how to work with Excel files, perform data processing, and create visualizations using the `openpyxl` library. It includes a simple example of loading an Excel file, modifying data, and generating a bar chart from the modified data.

## Features

- **Data Modification:** The project reads an Excel file (`transactions.xlsx`) and calculates corrected prices by applying a 10% discount to a specific column.

- **Data Visualization:** It creates a bar chart from the corrected prices and embeds it into the Excel sheet.

- **Export:** The modified data with corrected prices and the embedded chart are saved into a new Excel file (`transactions2.xlsx`).

pip install openpyxl
python data_processing.py
